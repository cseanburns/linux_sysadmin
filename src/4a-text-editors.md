# Text editors

In this section, we will cover and:

1. **Understand the role of text editors**: Recognize the importance of text
   editors in the command-line environment for saving commands, writing
   scripts, and editing configuration files.
2. **Differentiate between text editors**: Identify key differences between
   line editors like `ed` and visual editors like `vim`, `nano`, `micro`, and
   `tilde`.
3. **Operate a line editor**: Use basic commands in `ed`, such as addressing
   lines, manipulating text, and editing files.
4. **Explore the functionality of `vim`**: Understand the basic modal operation
   of `vim`, including command mode, insert mode, and how to integrate shell
   commands within the editor.
5. **Utilize beginner-friendly editors**: Comfortably use `nano`, `micro`,
   `tilde`, and `edit` for straightforward text editing tasks, taking advantage of their
   user-friendly key bindings and interfaces.
6. **Appreciate historical context**: Recognize the historical significance of
   `ed` and `vim` and how their development has influenced modern computing
   practices.

## Getting Started

Working on the command line means writing a lot of commands.
There will be times when we want to save some of the commands that we write in order to re-use them later.
Or, we might want to develop the commands into a script (i.e., a program) because we might want to automate a process.
The shell is great for writing one off commands, so-called **one-liners**, but
it's not a great place to write multi-line or very long commands.
Therefore it can be helpful to write and save our commands in a text editor.

In this lesson, we'll learn about several text editors: `ed`, `vim`, `nano`, `micro`, and `tilde`.
We cover `ed` primarily for its historical importance, but it's a perfectly fine editor that I use all the time.
`vim` is a more powerful and quite flexible editor that is widely used today, but it has a high learning curve.
Even after using it for nearly 25 years, I'm still learning things about it.
We could have a whole course on `vim`, but given the little time we have together,
I will encourage you to use `nano`, `micro`, `tilde`, or `edit`.

I want you to know something about `ed` and `vim` because these are historically important editors.
I use `ed` almost often, and `vim` is my everyday editor.
I'm even writing this in `vim`!
Vim is hugely popular, under active development.
If you want to use Vim, I'd encourage you to do so.
Once you've acquired skill with it, working with text is a joyful experience.
But I don't teach it because would take too much time and practice to learn it.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the shell that we are working with is called `bash`, and
`bash` is a full-fledged programming language.
That means that when we write a simple command, like `cd public_html`, we are programming.
It makes sense that the more programming that we do, the better we'll get at it.
This requires  more sophisticated environments to help manage our programs than the command line prompt can provide.
Text editors fulfill that role.

As we learn more about how to do systems administration with Linux, we will need to edit configuration files, too.
Most configuration files exist in the `/etc` directory.
For example, later in the semester we will install the [Apache Web Server][apache], and
we will need to edit Apache's configuration files in the process.
We could do this using some of the tools that we've already covered, like `sed` and `awk`, but
it'll make our lives much easier to use a text editor.

In any case, in order to save our commands or edit text files,  a text editor is very helpful.
Programmers use text editors to write programs, but programmers often work in graphical user environments, so
they often use GUI text editors or [IDE][ide]s. 
As systems administrators, it would be unusual to have a graphical user interface installed on a server.
The servers that we manage will contain limited or specific software that serves the server's main purpose.
Additional software on a server that is not relevant to the main function of a server only takes up extra disk space,
consumes valuable computing resources, and poses an additional security footprint.

As stated, although `ed` and `vim` are difficult to learn, they are very powerful editors.
I believe they are both worth learning; however, for the purposes of this course, it's more important that you are aware of them.
If you wish to learn more, there are lots of additional tutorials on the web on how to use these fine, esteemed text editors.

## `ed`

`ed` is a line editor that is installed by default on many Linux distributions.
Ken Thompson created `ed` in the late 1960s to write the original Unix operating system.
It was used without computer monitors because those were still uncommon, and
instead for [teletypewriters (TTYs)][ttys] and [printers][printers].
The lack of a visual display, like a monitor, is the reason that `ed` was written as a line editor.
If you visit that second link, you will see the terminal interface from those earlier days.
It is the same basic interface you are using now when you use your terminal applications, which
are virtualised versions of those old teletypewriters.
I think this is a testament of the power of the terminal: that advanced computer users still use the same basic technology today.

In practice, when we use a line editor like `ed`, the main process of entering text is like any other editor.
The big difference is when we need to manipulate text.
In a graphical text editor, if we want to delete a word or edit some text,
we might backspace over the text or highlight a word and delete it.
In a line editor, we manipulate text by referring to lines or across multiple lines and
then run commands on the text in those line(s).
This is process we followed when we covered `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`, and especially `sed`, and
it should not surprise you that [these are related to ed][oreillyEd].

To operationalize this, like in `sed`, each line has an **address**.
The address for line 7 is **7**, and so forth.
Line editors like `ed` are command driven. 
There is no menu to select from at the top of the *window*.
In fact, when we used `ed` to open an existing file, the text in the file isn't even printed on the screen.
If a user wants to delete a word, or print (to screen) some text,
the user has to command the line editor to print the relevant line.
The do this by specifying the line's address and issuing a command to delete the word on that line, or print the line.
Line editors also work on ranges of line, including all the lines in the file, just like `sed` does.

Many of the commands that `ed` uses are also used by `sed`, since `sed` is based on `ed`.
The following table compares commands between these two programs:

| Command         | `sed`   | `ed`   |
| ---------       | ------- | ------ |
| append text     | `a`     | `a`    |
| replace text    | `c`     | `c`    |
| delete text     | `d`     | `d`    |
| insert text     | `i`     | `i`    |
| print text      | `p`     | `p`    |
| substitute text | `s`     | `s`    |
| print w/ line # | `=`     | `n`    |

However, there are big differences that mainly relate to the fact that `ed` is a text editor and `sed` is not (really).
For example, here are some commands that mostly make sense in `ed` as a text editor.
`sed` can do some of these tasks, where it makes sense (e.g., we don't quit `sed`), but sometimes in a non-trivial way.

| Command                  | `ed` only     |
| ---------                | ------------- |
| edit file                | `e`           |
| join lines               | `j`           |
| copies lines             | `t`           |
| moves lines              | `m`           |
| undo                     | `u`           |
| saves file               | `w`           |
| quits `ed` before saving | `q`           |
| Quits `ed` w/o saving    | `Q`           |

There are other differences, but these are sufficient for our purposes.

Let's see how to use `ed` to open a file, and print the content with and without line numbers.

```
ed operating-systems.csv
183

5	iOS, Proprietary, 2007
6	macOS, Proprietary, 2001
7	Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
8	Android, Apache, 2008
```

Using `ed`, another way to remove the header line of the **operating-systems.csv** file is to specify the line number (`1`) and
then the delete command (`d`), just like in `sed`.
This becomes a permanent change if I save the file with the `w` (write) command:

```
1d
1,$p
Chrome OS, Proprietary, 2009
FreeBSD, BSD, 1993
Linux, GPL, 1991
iOS, Proprietary, 2007
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Android, Apache, 2008
```

To refer to line **ranges**, I add a comma between **addresses**.
Therefore, to delete lines 1, 2, and 3, and then quit without saving:

```
1,3d
,p
iOS, Proprietary, 2007
macOS, Proprietary, 2001
Windows NT, Proprietary, 1993
Android, Apache, 2008
Q
```

Note that with `sed`, in order to make a change **in-place**, we need to use the `-i` option.
But with `ed`, we save changes with the `w` command.

I can use `ed` to **find and replace** strings.
The syntax is the same as it is in `sed`.
I'll start with a fresh version of the file:

```
ed operating-systems.csv
183
1,$s/Linux/GNU\/Linux/
```

If we want to add new rows to the file, we can append `a` or insert `i` text after or at specific lines.
To append text after line 3, use `a`.
We enter a period on a newline to leave input mode and return to command mode:

```
3a
FreeDOS, GPL, 1998
.
```

Because we enter input mode when using the `a`, `i`, or `c` commands, we enter a period `.` on a line by itself to revert to command mode.

To insert at line 2, use `i`:

```
2i
CP/M, Proprietary, 1974
.
```

Like `sed`, we can also **find and replace** using regular expressions instead of line numbers.
I start a new `ed` session to reload the file to start fresh:

```
ed operating-systems.csv
183
/Linux/s/Linux/GNU\/Linux/
```

Of course, `ed` can be used to write and not simply edit files.
Let's start fresh.
In the following session,
I'll start `ed`, enter append mode `a`, write a short letter, exit append mode `.`, name the file `f`, write `w` (save) the file, and quit `q`:

```
ed
a
Dear Students,

I hope you find this really interesting.
Feel free to practice and play on the command line,
as well as use tools like ed, the standard editor.

Sincerely,
Dr. Burns
.
f letter.txt
w
q
```

It's good to know something about `ed` for historical reasons.
But the line editing technology developed for it is still in use today, and is a basic part of the `vim` text editor.

## `vim`

The `vim` text editor is an **improved** version of the `vi` text editor and is in fact called **Vi IMproved**.
The original `vi` text editor is usually available via the `nvi` editor these days.
`nvi` is a rewrite of the original.
`vim` is a visual editor.
It is multi-modal like `ed` and is a direct descendant through [vi][vi].
Due to this genealogy, `vim` uses many of the same commands as `ed` does when `vim` is in command mode.
Like `ed`, we can start `vim` at the Bash prompt with or without a file name.
Here I open the **letter.txt** file with `vim`.
The default mode is **command mode**:

```
vim letter.txt
Dear Students,

I hope you find this really interesting.
Feel free to practice and play on the command line,
as well as use tools like ed, the standard editor.

Sincerely,
Dr. Burns
```

To enter **insert mode**, I can type `i` or `a` for **insert** or **append** mode.
There isn't any difference on an empty file, but on a file that has text,
`i` will start **insert** mode before the cursor position, and `a` will **insert** mode after the cursor position.
Once in **insert** mode, you can type text as you normally would and use the arrow keys to navigate around the file.

To return to **command mode** in `vim`, you press the **Esc** key.
And then you can enter commands like you would with `ed`, using the same syntax.

Unlike `ed`, when in **command mode**, the commands we type are not placed wherever the cursor is, but at the bottom of the screen.
Let's first turn on line numbers to know which address is which, and then we'll replace **ed** with **Ed**.
Note that I precede these commands with a colon:

```
:set number
:5s/ed/Ed/
```

One of the more powerful things about both `ed` and `vim` is that I can call Bash shell commands from the editors.
Let's say that I wanted to add the date to my letter file.
To do that, Linux has a command called `date` that will return today's date and time.
To call the `date` command within Vim and insert the output into the file:
I press **Esc** to enter **command mode** (if I'm not already in it),
enter a colon, type `r` for the read into buffer command,
then enter the shell escape command, which is an exclamation point `!`, and then the Bash shell `date` command:

```
:r !date
Dear Students,

I hope you find this really interesting.
Feel free to practice and play on the command line,
as well as use tools like ed, the standard editor.

Sincerely,
Dr. Burns
```

Since the last edit I made was to replace **ed** with **Ed**, `vim` entered the date after that line, which is line 6.
To move that date line to the top of the letter, I can use the move `m` command and move it to line 0, which is the top of the file:

```
:6m0

Dear Students,

I hope you find this really interesting.

as well as use tools like Ed, the standard editor.

```

You can use the arrow keys and Page Up/Page Down keys to navigate in `vim` and `vi`,
But by far the most excellent thing about this editor is to be able to use the **j,k,l,h** keys to navigate around a file:

- `j` moves down line by line
- `k` moves up line by line
- `l` moves right letter by letter
- `h` moves left letter by letter

Like the other commands, you can precede this with addresses. To move 2 lines down, you type `2j`, and so forth.
`vi` and `vim` have had a powerful impact on software development that programmers have built these keystrokes
into applications like Gmail, Facebook, and more.

To save the file and exit `vim`, return to **command mode** by pressing the `Esc` key, and then write and quit:

```
:wq
```

The above barely scratches the surface.
There are whole books on these editors as well as websites, videos, etc that explore them, and especially `vim` in more detail.
But now that you have some familiarity with them, you might find this funny: [Ed, man! !man ed][maned].

## `nano`

The `nano` text editor is the user-friendliest of these text editors but still requires some adjustment as a new commandline user.
The friendliest thing about `nano` is that it is modeless.
You're already accustomed to using modeless editors in GUI apps.
It simply means that you can add and manipulate text without changing to insert or command mode.
It is also friendly because it uses control keys to perform its operations.
The tricky part is that the control keys are assigned to different keystroke combinations.
For example, instead of Ctrl-c or Cmd-c to copy,
in `nano` you press the `M-6` key (press `Alt`, `Cmd`, or `Esc` key and `6`) to copy.
Then to paste, you press `Ctrl-u` instead of the more common `Ctrl-v`.
Fortunately, `nano` lists the shortcuts at the bottom of the screen.

The shortcuts listed need some explanation, though.
The carat mark is shorthand for the keyboard's **Control (Ctrl)** key.
Therefore to **Save As** a file, we **write** out the file by pressing `Ctrl-o`.
The **M-** key is also important, and depending on your keyboard configuration,
it may correspond to your `Alt`, `Cmd`, or `Esc` keys.
To search for text, you press `^W`, If your goal is to copy, then press **M-6** to copy a line.
Move to where you want to paste the text, and press **Ctrl-u** to paste.

For the purposes of this class, that's all you really need to know about `nano`.
Use it and get comfortable writing in it.
Some quick tips:

1. `nano file.txt` will open and display the file named **file.txt**.
2. `nano` by itself will open to an empty page.
3. Save a file by pressing `Ctrl-o`.
4. Quit and save by pressing `Ctrl-x`.
5. Be sure to follow the prompts at the bottom of the screen.

## `micro` and `tilde`

`nano` is usually installed by default on many Linux distributions, which is why I cover it here.
However, if you want to use a more modern terminal editor, then I suggest `micro` or `tilde`.

To install the first two, I'll run the following command:

```
sudo apt install micro tilde
```

Then we launch them with or without file names.
To launch `micro`:

```
micro
```

To launch `tilde`:

```
tilde
```

The [micro][micro] text editor uses standard key combinations like **Ctrl-S** to save, **Ctrl-O** to open, **Ctrl-Q** to quit.
The [tilde][tilde] text editor also uses the standard key combinations, but it also has a menu bar.
To access the menu bar, you press the **Alt** key plus the first letter of the menu bar option.
For example, **Alt-f** opens the **File Menu**, etc.

## `edit`

The [edit][ms_edit] text editor is a very new, open source editor from Microsoft.
It is built for use on Windows but can be installed on Linux.
To install, visit the program's [GitHub releases][ms_edit_releases] link and copy the URL for the file named:
**edit-[version]-x86-64-linux-gnu.tar.zst**, where **[version]** equals the most recent version.
Then we'll use `wget` to download the source file to our servers.
For example, to download the most recent version, which at the time of writing this is `1.2.0`:

```
wget https://github.com/microsoft/edit/releases/download/v1.2.0/edit-1.2.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.zst
```

The file is compressed.
To decompress it, we use the following `tar` command:

```
tar --use-compress-program=unzstd -xvf edit-1.2.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.zst
```

This will output a file called `edit`.
Move this file to an executable `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`:

```
sudo mv edit /usr/local/bin
```

Once moved, you can `edit` like you use the other editors.
Note that the GitHub page for `edit` provides instructions for installing this editor on Windows,
in case you're interested in doing so.

## Conclusion

In prior lessons, we learned how to use the `bash` command prompt and how to view, manipulate, and edit files from that shell.
In this lesson, we learned how to use several command line text editors.
Editors allow us to save our commands, create scripts, and in the future, edit configuration files.

The commands we used in this lesson include:

- `ed` : line-oriented text editor
- `vim` : Vi IMproved, a programmer's text editor
- `nano` : Nano's ANOther editor, inspired by Pico
- `micro`: A modern and intuitive terminal-based text editor
- `tilde`: The Tilde Text Editor
- `edit`: Microsoft text editor
