# Project Management

In this section, you will learn how to use [Google Cloud][gcloud] (gcloud) to install and manage Linux servers as virtual machines.
We will specifically use `gcloud` to create virtual instances of the Ubuntu Server Linux operating system.

This section will also introduce you to [Git][git] and [GitHub][github].
You will use these technologies to download software but more importantly to document your work.
